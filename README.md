## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to extract form data using the `FormData` interface and I was introduced to the `checkValidity()` method which allowed me to simply use the native HTML form validation even while preventing the default browser behaviour.
